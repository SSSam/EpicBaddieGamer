# Welcome to EpicBaddieGamers
## Our Inspiration
It may be 2021, but in our hearts dabbing is not dead like our souls! We wanted to spread the joy of dabbing once more, cause we could all use a little more cringe in our lives. 
## What it does
Dab at the haters and unlock new baddies to dab with! Features 100% original, copyright-free characters.
## How we built it
Android Studio / Java / a LOT of blood sweat and tears
## Challenges we ran into
Learning the new environment + language + anxiety+ Trying to be funny
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning new languages, working with our team, and making our project work! Also dabbing over 10,000 times. Wow!
## What we learned
Android Studio / Java / Teamwork :)
## What's next for Epic Baddie Gamers
More achievements? Auto-clicking features? Idle dabbing? Possibilities are endless. Wow...
And maybe~~ Launch our app in the Google Play Store
